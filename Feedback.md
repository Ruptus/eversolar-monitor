 So, what have you set up, did it work, and were there any obstacles?

Hi Solmoller.
Back in 2012 I build and installed a Eversolar monitor based on the descriptions made in Solcelle debat. This has worked well since, but this summer it stop working. I had a lot of drop outs and suddently is stop completely to work. I have an extra SD card with the Debian OS and now I want to install the Eversolar-monitor.ini by writing git clone https:/code.google.com/p/eversolar-monitor/ as describen in one of the documents from back then. But it does not work. I get the error message  Fatel: https://code.google.com/p/eversolar-monitor/infor/refs not valid: is this a git repository.
What should I type to get the eversolar.ini file on the SD card?
Best regards. Karsten Eriksen.
